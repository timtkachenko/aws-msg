TODO list for the `aws-msg` library:

**1. Error Handling:**

- Add comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase.
- Implement retries and backoff strategies for AWS SDK calls to handle transient errors.

**2. Logging and Monitoring:**

- Integrate a logging framework (e.g., `logrus`) for better visibility into the library's operations.

**3. Code Comments and Documentation:**

- Add comments to clarify complex code sections and function purposes.
- Generate detailed code documentation (e.g., GoDoc) for easy reference.

**4. Code Duplication Reduction:**

- Identify and eliminate code duplication where applicable.
- Refactor common code patterns into reusable functions or methods.

**5. Testing and Test Coverage:**

- Write unit tests for library functions and aim for high test coverage.
- Implement integration tests using AWS SDK mocks or local AWS services (e.g., Localstack).

**6. Exception Handling:**

- Replace panic statements with proper error handling to prevent unexpected crashes.

**7. Naming Conventions:**

- Ensure consistent and descriptive variable and function names following Go naming conventions.

**8. Resource Cleanup:**

- Implement proper resource cleanup (e.g., closing connections, releasing locks) in all relevant places.

**9. Consistency in API Design:**

- Review and ensure consistency in function signatures and parameter naming.

**10. Performance Optimization:**

- Profile and optimize critical code paths for better performance.
- Evaluate AWS SDK configurations for optimal resource usage.

**11. Dependencies and Dependency Management:**

- Regularly update third-party dependencies to maintain security and compatibility.
- Document the library's dependencies and version requirements.

**12. Code Formatting and Linting:**

- Enforce code formatting and style guidelines using tools like `gofmt` and linters (e.g., `golint`, `golangci-lint`).

**13. Error Reporting and Logging Standards:**

- Define and adhere to a consistent error reporting and logging standard throughout the library.

**14. Context Cancellation:**

- Ensure proper handling of context cancellation and resource cleanup when contexts are canceled.

**15. Code Refactoring:**

- Consider breaking down long functions or methods into smaller, more manageable units.
